# portfolio monte carlo simulation 🇲🇨

customizable monte carlo simulation for common retirement portfolio archetypes 

## description

the monte carlo simulation provides a valuable assessment for long term investors. this project allows the user to select their portfolio type, input their current portfolio value, and set a time frame for the simulations. the ui/ux is intended to simplify the process so someone with very-little investment knoweldge can still use this tool. the project then provides two graphs: (1) historical time-series of stocks in the users portfolio and (2) simulations of future portfolio value.

### how it works
* uses pandas and yfinance to access and clean 🧼
* utilizes plotly to create interactive time series plots 📈
* implements monte carlo simulations to simulate future portfolio action 😄
